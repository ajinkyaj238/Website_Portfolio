                    Growing up in Singapore, I loved playing video games and spent countless hours researching about the best CPU's and GPU's to build the build the best gaming PC. 
                    When I finally was able to build it, I seemed more interested in the process of learning more about computer hardware than playing the games.
                    This led me to pursue Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern.
                    As an ECE major, I have been exposed to many different subfields that require the development of a wide range of skills. In terms of relevance, these skills include C/C++ for hardware/software co-design, along with Python and MATLAB in data-driven engineering.
                    Over the years I have worked on and developed many projects that have helped me develop a strong foundation in both hardware and software design. You can take a look at some of my skills and projects if you scroll down. 
                    Having said that, the biggest skill I've learned is the ability to learn and learn to new technologies and concepts quickly and being able to apply them in any project I work on. <br /><br />
                    <strong>There is no technical skill that I cannot learn and apply to a project. It all comes down to the project that I work on and what would be the most efficient tool I can use to get the job done.</strong>
